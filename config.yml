            Hi! I'm Theo, and welcome to my site ( â— â€¿â—  ) <br>
            I'm currently an Incoming Machine Learning Researcher at Shanghai Jiaotong University. <br>
            I'll be starting a Master of Statistics at the University of Hong Kong in this year!
            <br><br>

            So far, I worked in several software roles in both industry and academia. I was a Data Scientist
            for Oxbridge Economics under Dr. Yuanshuo Qu. I also worked as a DevOps Engineer, at
            the Vancouver School of Economics under Dr. Jonathan Graves. Finally, I was a Data Engineer at HKU Business School 
            under Dr. Yang Liu and Dr. Yaoyuan Zhang.
            <br><br>

            I just finished a Bachelor of Economics, Finance, and Computer Science at the University of Hong Kong. At
            the same time, I was a Teaching Assistant for COMP1117 and COMP2113.
            <br><br>

            I was born and raised in the city of Jakarta, Indonesia in the land of spicy food ðŸŒ´ <br>
            I really enjoy learning cool stuff and teaching it to other people ðŸ“– <br>
